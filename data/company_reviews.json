Our CRO/President is an amazing, inspirational leader.  CMO - excellent with great instincts. CPO - has led a renaissance in our product strategy and revolutionized our product line literally over the past year -- amazing!  Sales leadership - doing the right things right.\n\nI really feel we have turned a major corner with regard to company and product strategy. HR policies are almost unbelievably employee-centric, and much appreciated by the employee base. Alteryx has  made a lot a progress on Diversity and Inclusion for those employees that this matters to.\n\nAgain, things are almost 180 degrees different than they were a year ago, and we are very very grateful for your hard work.

Three weeks is unacceptable for senior employees coming from companies where they had 6-8 weeks of annual paid vacation. This NEEDS to be fixed\r\n\r\n- Still a few horrible executives who demoralize employees, but these are being addressed on an ongoing basis\r\n\r\n- A lot of employee churn, which has been hugely disruptive to the organization overall. This is slowly stabilizing and improving. SLOWLY\r\n\r\n- Lack of strong innovation and sustained leadership and vision on the product side, although early signs are that this is changing for the better\r\n\r\n- Alteryx has quite a number of \"small company\" type processes and things that take away from a positive professional employee experience: traveling employees as a rule don't get corporate credit cards (you have to pay for business expenses with personal card and get reimbursed); it takes WEEKS AND WEEKS to get reimbursed after filing an expense report; huge level of stinginess on travel expenses -- for example, you have extra layers of approval triggered if you go even a few dollars above \"recommended\" airfare or hotel cost thresholds (which are very low); daily meal allowances for travel are exceedingly low, particularly if you travel to large cities; the list goes on.....\r\n\r\n- Attrition of tenured employees over the past 18 months has been VERY HIGH.

      "cons": "There is a lot of good about Alteryx, but the core - the culture and the way you treat employees - really took a hit. Some of the upper management you hired causes more harm than good, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nSomething that really and truly, so much, made things so much worse is the way you all handled the D matter. \r\nWhat would have happened if one of us non-management employees would have done something like that? We would have been fired IMMEDIATELY. How come that he was still at Alteryx for a while, and how come that there were no consequences for the CEO who supported him?! How is that acceptable?\r\n\r\nChanges do bring upside downs, bumps and hiccups, that is just normal, but at some point the hiccups should get less and not more.\r\n\r\n-  You put leadership in place without carefully considering if they even have the knowledge to fulfill what they were hired for - and worse, no one seems to check up on if they do a good job.\r\n\r\n- Alteryx moved people around - great and smart people who are hard working - just because it seems to be a great idea, entirely overlooking that someone who was hired to do X, has no interest in doing Y. If you change people's job over night, don't you see and understand that this is more than discouraging? Employees who were passionate before because they loved what they were doing, all of a sudden find themselves in a job they never wanted to be in. This hurts the moral and working spirit A LOT!\r\nHow come HR changes job titles over night, just like that? I have never seen a Sales Manager or Sales VP become an IT Manager or IT VP over night. I assume its because a manager or VP of Sales has strength in everything around selling and wouldn't do well in an area they are likely not familiar with, right? Do you think this is any different for your employees who are switched to do different work over night? I am not talking about taking on new responsibilities in the same team or dept, I am talking major unwanted job change. Think being a passionate carpenter today and tomorrow you are asked to design cars and make them drive. \r\n\r\n- Some managers and directors come in and change up things right away without even taking the time to see how things work now, looking into the strength of their employees, what everyone brings to the table, and what would make things better. They come in and immediately change everything, whether it makes sense or not. Managers, directors, VPs, they are not the only ones who see if things go the wrong way. Your employees do too, probably even more so. So, ask them, let them help to contribute to the big picture.\r\n\r\n- It became more and more common to start your working day with a note that the high priority project you worked so hard on for the past week, all of a sudden is declared not so important. That happens quite a lot. Its a waste of time, and unprofessional, unfair - because one put all the passion, time and over hrs into it - and with a blink of an eye, direction changes. Wouldn't you expect a manager, director, etc to know what the goals are, what the outcomes, the team's targets are, and then plan accordingly? Not just switching back and forth. There is not much stability left.\r\n\r\n- Long hrs are taken for granted. I'd have yet to hear \"hey, you worked very long hrs this week and as appreciation, take half day off.\" That would be a great way to show appreciation. An Alteryx cup or t-shirt really doesn't count as appreciation for extra good work.\r\n\r\n- Promotions are ridiculous. Do we even have promotions for non-Sales teams? For the \"normal\" people?\r\n\r\n- Why don't you implement more frequent surveys, especially in times where things change so much. If you did surveys in the past, did they even go all the way up? Did management, directors, VPs and the CEO see the results?\r\n\r\n- We lost several people within a month in one department (a rather small one): isn't that enough clue? But instead of raising a red flag, no one seems to care. How come there is new management in place, and all of a sudden people leave left and right - isn't that noticed?\r\n\r\nThe statement \"employees first, we value them so much, couldn't be where we are without them\", doesn't seem to translate anymore, which is sad.",

      "cons": "Firstly, the ONLY reason I'm not going with a 1 star. During their initial orientation (referred to as \"boot camp\" there), the CEO of the company will walk in and before he even introduces himself he will open it with \"this will be the hardest job you'll ever have, but also the most rewarding\" and while I disagree with this job being rewarding whatsoever, he was upfront in it being a tough job.\r\n\r\nAnyways, onto the cons. While I mentioned it being a pro, there is a reason the salary and the commission is so high here......this is a tough sale. You are cold calling, emailing, LinkedIn messaging 1,000+ businesses (which are provided to you) by researching the companies and researching the potential customers that fit the mold on LinkedIn, Zoom Info ETC. Out of 20 people you may get a hold of, you are lucky if MAYBE 1 of them wants to even hear you out (this is pretty standard in cold call sales).\r\n\r\nThis job is a grind, but to be fair, during the interview process, the managers are very upfront in this regard. I have 16 successful years in different types of sales and let me say, this is a completely different beast. The STRESS (read below) this job will put on you, you may want to re-consider before accepting an offer here.\r\n\r\nSo everything I've put so far, the pay is good, they were upfront with this being hard etc, so why do I list these as cons when I knowingly went into this?\r\n\r\nWith a new company there are learning curves.....systems, product etc. I was here for 8 months and toward the end I felt I knew the product/systems SOMEWHAT. It'd be one thing if this was just me but you can ask ANYONE there, and they'll all tell you it takes at least a year to feel somewhat comfortable with the product.\r\n\r\nOnboarding was really where I knew things weren't going to go well. When I started, I sat in a different area away from the team I was on and not only away from my team, I sat with A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT. In addition to this, after those 2 months, I was switched to a completely different team with a new manager.\r\n\r\nMy headline really says it all. There is absolutely ZERO positive reinforcement. The managers have done this job before so they know the grind and instead of giving you props for the things you did well and working with you on ways to improve the things you can do better, they only focus on the negative aspects. For example, if you create the most opportunities, instead of giving you kudos for that, it's just digging into why your other opportunities aren't progressing.......you could literally do 4 good things and if there was 1 thing to nitpick on, that's ALL that'd be focused on. I would absolutely DREAD the weekly 1:1's with my manager as I knew it was a hammer coming down on me for 30 minutes (which it ALWAYS was).\r\n\r\nNEVER in my career have I ever felt worthless, lack of confidence etc, but at Alteryx, I felt like a legit worthless piece of crap day in and day out. My wife would tell me countless times that she has NEVER seen stress on my face until this job. Keep in mind, this was all during a pandemic where EVERYONE there was struggling (rightfully so), yet NOTHING was good enough and I can't even imagine what this job would be like post covid.",

      "advice": "In my opinion, leadership/management should reassess their focus/roadmap and should redouble their investment in Designer. Build and expand incrementally from it as a battle-tested platform. When updating a product line, be smart about leveraging existing functionality, do not reinvent the wheel, and do not succumb to the urge to rewrite all functionality from scratch! Be open-minded about how to market new product lines in light of how the user base chooses to embrace them (or not).",
      "cons": "A lot of little pet projects- many of which flounder about wasting resources and never coming to fruition. Frustrating to see resources wasted on things that-- even if they do get completed-- the customers really don't want as much as leadership/management thinks they do.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there is a large disconnect between leadership/management and our user base. Leadership/management is out of touch with our main product (Designer) and the niche value it provides. For example, having seen many years of quarterly innovation days, leadership/management does not contribute/participate. (Participation, otherwise, is usually very high across the company-- even outside of the engineering org.)\r\n\r\nWhen the company wants to update/modernize a product line (e.g., server), the tendency has always been to rewrite all functionality from scratch. With decades-old legacy products and a bunch of rosy-eyed (usually newly-hired) developers, this leads to a lot of reinventing the wheel (in the best case) and a lot of new problems (in the worst case). This has happened time and time again with various iterations of lightweight, web-based versions of both the desktop and server products. Every time, there is a naivete (or perhaps hubris) that THIS rewrite will avoid all of the problems from the previous rewrites; more often, there are just new defects and anomalies being introduced (not all of which are being identified).\r\n\r\nIn response to diverging visions, there seems to be a tendency to terminate many passionate advocates for the main product (including the original CTO, who wrote this product himself). This has led to displaced/disjointed excitement for the product and an overall decrease in morale across (at least) the engineering org.",

He is super gregarious and a great representative for the company/product/brand. His big data catchphrases simply grow trite; if you've heard a couple of Dean speeches, you've pretty much heard Dean. Very nice guy though and attempts to connect with and show appreciation for all areas of the org (although he is clearly a sales guy at heart).\r\n\r\n6-month outlook will depend upon how releases of new product lines fare (and whether or not the user base embraces these new experiences). A lot of potential for success here, but also a lot of ways the company could misstep. e.g., Misrepresenting one of these new product lines as a replacement for the previous XYZ product line (or for the partner's/competitor's ABC product line) could aggravate users.",

The culture is a little middle management heavy. You need to attract rockstar engineers, promote them, reward them. At the end of the day this is a technical product and you need technical talent to continue to maintain / grow the product. \r\n- Continue to hire data science aware engineers, it was quite shocking to me how few engineers there knew data science basics.

Help the data scientists learn basics of software, help the software engineers to learn basics of data science, and or, hire engineers with experience in data science.",

      "advice": "POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT!! This type of job sucks (EVERYONE there knows this), BUT it pays the bills and it needs to be done. Show the reps there you legit have their back and not make them feel worthless.",
      "cons": "Firstly, the ONLY reason I'm not going with a 1 star. During their initial orientation (referred to as \"boot camp\" there), the CEO of the company will walk in and before he even introduces himself he will open it with \"this will be the hardest job you'll ever have, but also the most rewarding\" and while I disagree with this job being rewarding whatsoever, he was upfront in it being a tough job.\r\n\r\nAnyways, onto the cons. While I mentioned it being a pro, there is a reason the salary and the commission is so high here......this is a tough sale. You are cold calling, emailing, LinkedIn messaging 1,000+ businesses (which are provided to you) by researching the companies and researching the potential customers that fit the mold on LinkedIn, Zoom Info ETC. Out of 20 people you may get a hold of, you are lucky if MAYBE 1 of them wants to even hear you out (this is pretty standard in cold call sales).\r\n\r\nThis job is a grind, but to be fair, during the interview process, the managers are very upfront in this regard. I have 16 successful years in different types of sales and let me say, this is a completely different beast. The STRESS (read below) this job will put on you, you may want to re-consider before accepting an offer here.\r\n\r\nSo everything I've put so far, the pay is good, they were upfront with this being hard etc, so why do I list these as cons when I knowingly went into this?\r\n\r\nWith a new company there are learning curves.....systems, product etc. I was here for 8 months and toward the end I felt I knew the product/systems SOMEWHAT. It'd be one thing if this was just me but you can ask ANYONE there, and they'll all tell you it takes at least a year to feel somewhat comfortable with the product.\r\n\r\nOnboarding was really where I knew things weren't going to go well. When I started, I sat in a different area away from the team I was on and not only away from my team, I sat with A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT. In addition to this, after those 2 months, I was switched to a completely different team with a new manager.\r\n\r\nMy headline really says it all. There is absolutely ZERO positive reinforcement. The managers have done this job before so they know the grind and instead of giving you props for the things you did well and working with you on ways to improve the things you can do better, they only focus on the negative aspects. For example, if you create the most opportunities, instead of giving you kudos for that, it's just digging into why your other opportunities aren't progressing.......you could literally do 4 good things and if there was 1 thing to nitpick on, that's ALL that'd be focused on. I would absolutely DREAD the weekly 1:1's with my manager as I knew it was a hammer coming down on me for 30 minutes (which it ALWAYS was).\r\n\r\nNEVER in my career have I ever felt worthless, lack of confidence etc, but at Alteryx, I felt like a legit worthless piece of crap day in and day out. My wife would tell me countless times that she has NEVER seen stress on my face until this job. Keep in mind, this was all during a pandemic where EVERYONE there was struggling (rightfully so), yet NOTHING was good enough and I can't even imagine what this job would be like post covid.",

Be open-minded about how to market new product lines in light of how the user base chooses to embrace them (or not).",
      "cons": "A lot of little pet projects- many of which flounder about wasting resources and never coming to fruition. Frustrating to see resources wasted on things that-- even if they do get completed-- the customers really don't want as much as leadership/management thinks they do.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there is a large disconnect between leadership/management and our user base. Leadership/management is out of touch with our main product (Designer) and the niche value it provides. For example, having seen many years of quarterly innovation days, leadership/management does not contribute/participate. (Participation, otherwise, is usually very high across the company-- even outside of the engineering org.)\r\n\r\nWhen the company wants to update/modernize a product line (e.g., server), the tendency has always been to rewrite all functionality from scratch. With decades-old legacy products and a bunch of rosy-eyed (usually newly-hired) developers, this leads to a lot of reinventing the wheel (in the best case) and a lot of new problems (in the worst case). This has happened time and time again with various iterations of lightweight, web-based versions of both the desktop and server products. Every time, there is a naivete (or perhaps hubris) that THIS rewrite will avoid all of the problems from the previous rewrites; more often, there are just new defects and anomalies being introduced (not all of which are being identified).\r\n\r\nIn response to diverging visions, there seems to be a tendency to terminate many passionate advocates for the main product (including the original CTO, who wrote this product himself). This has led to displaced/disjointed excitement for the product and an overall decrease in morale across (at least) the engineering org.",

HR, of whom I will not mention any specific names, exemplifies incompetence. But they act as if they are coequals with Jesus himself. It is interesting to see the amount of reviews that refer to the culture as toxic and couldn't be more true. You will hear stories of things you'd only expect to hear on a lifetime movie. There have been dozens of great people who have left because management refuses to address the problems that pollute every organization in one way or another. But hey, let's continue to just hire people we know, it doesn't matter if they have the knowledge and leadership skills to perform the job. I would say 75% of the company comes from a handful of companies in the valley. Not because there is no other talent, but because candidates can see through the BS in their interview process and it leaves HR with no choice but to go find their friends from other companies. Which by the way it helps build out their clique. Once you join, be wary of the individuals who kissed your a - $ - $  to get you to join the company, only to become influencers of the rampant high school drama, backbiting, harassment and bullying.",

Alteryx is actually an old company that is just now getting the recognition it deserves. The growth has been amazing, but it is not the unstable type growth that you see with hot start ups that just fizzles away in a year or two. Alteryx is built to last, and if you're looking for a stable job with a stable company that isn't going to vanish overnight, then this is the place for you. Alteryx also has a great culture with great people. People here love to connect and team building outings are encouraged regular. After a year here I feel like i've really been able to connect with my piers. That feels great after several years of working remote from home. Plus, alteryx will give you time to volunteer and give back to the community if that's important to you. \r\n\r\nBut, it's no free ride. Alteryx expects your best, and if you give your best and work hard, you will be rewarded and recognized. That's rare these days, especially in tech where companies work you to death and expect 80+ hr work weeks only to pile more and more on you till you burn out. Alteryx cares about the career aspirations of its employees, and wants you to be happy in your role, and that has been refreshing for me. Bottom line is, if you work hard and have a growth mindset, alteryx will work out great for you.",

This is not hyperbole. Many of us are sitting here wondering which bad decision it will be that will make it necessary for action to be taken on what we perceive as abundant examples of poor leadership. \r\n\r\nOne would think that, with our company\u2019s goal of becoming a billion dollar organization, we would want to double down on the culture that got us to the big leagues and, at the very least, be careful with whom we choose to be our leaders.  In particular, it\u2019s important to insure that when we bring leaders into our company externally that those individuals not bring the same bad practices that plagued the organizations they are presumably fleeing.  Since 2016, our director has taken a wrecking ball to nearly everything that made Alteryx a great place to work.  Important decisions are made in back rooms about tools, technologies, and processes without the council and expertise of the people who are affected by these decisions.  Now, you are more likely to hear about what your team will look like or what tech stack you\u2019ll be using from your manager than you are to be asked about what the best next move is.  Confusion is rampant across all teams about what our next gen strategy is after two years of knowing that a next gen platform is imminent.  We don\u2019t know how to advance our careers and move up.  We do know not to mistake an open door for an opportunity to speak the truth.  We are people persecuted and furloughed for dissenting and being honest.  You toe the line, present a unified front, or you sit down and shut up.\r\n\r\nManagement is upside down - it presumes to know what\u2019s best for contributors and has lost sight of the fact that they are public servants. Could we please have leaders who didn\u2019t constantly trip over their own egos, hush people in meetings, and misinterpret the fortune of being lucky enough to lead incredibly intelligent people to mean that they have divine wisdom or insight that allows them to rule people instead of serve them?  It would be incredibly refreshing to have one of our leaders stand up and say, \u201cOK, now I know I can find a lot of people who will agree with what I\u2019m saying, but I want to hear from those who don\u2019t\u201d  It doesn\u2019t take much to surround yourself with and trumpet feedback from people who always agree with you and pretend like dissent doesn\u2019t exit or, worse, not even know it exists.  \r\n\r\nIf the now dozens of talented, experienced, tenured employees that have parted ways with us isn\u2019t enough for us to wake up and realize something foul is amiss, what about the people who have voluntarily stepped down from leadership roles?  How much more will we need to hear about it \u201cjust being growing pains\u201d or the \u201ctransition from small company mindedness\u201d to \u201cbig company mindedness\u201d or it taking a special person to be a leader rather than a contributor?

Alteryx is actually an old company that is just now getting the recognition it deserves. The growth has been amazing, but it is not the unstable type growth that you see with hot start ups that just fizzles away in a year or two. Alteryx is built to last, and if you're looking for a stable job with a stable company that isn't going to vanish overnight, then this is the place for you. Alteryx also has a great culture with great people. People here love to connect and team building outings are encouraged regular. After a year here I feel like i've really been able to connect with my piers. That feels great after several years of working remote from home. Plus, alteryx will give you time to volunteer and give back to the community if that's important to you. \r\n\r\nBut, it's no free ride. Alteryx expects your best, and if you give your best and work hard, you will be rewarded and recognized. That's rare these days, especially in tech where companies work you to death and expect 80+ hr work weeks only to pile more and more on you till you burn out. Alteryx cares about the career aspirations of its employees, and wants you to be happy in your role, and that has been refreshing for me. Bottom line is, if you work hard and have a growth mindset, alteryx will work out great for you.",

Not to mention that he was undervalued/underpaid. His boss is clueless on how valuable he\u2019s to the company. Instead of promoting this former manager or getting him help, his boss decided to hire a Director without communicating to him.

      "cons": "When I talk about Alteryx it\u2019s like having a discussion about a dear friend who has recently lost his way.\r\n\r\nSimply put, engineering is plagued by the worst management I have ever witnessed (particularly at the Director level). This is not hyperbole. Many of us are sitting here wondering which bad decision it will be that will make it necessary for action to be taken on what we perceive as abundant examples of poor leadership. \r\n\r\nOne would think that, with our company\u2019s goal of becoming a billion dollar organization, we would want to double down on the culture that got us to the big leagues and, at the very least, be careful with whom we choose to be our leaders.  In particular, it\u2019s important to insure that when we bring leaders into our company externally that those individuals not bring the same bad practices that plagued the organizations they are presumably fleeing.  Since 2016, our director has taken a wrecking ball to nearly everything that made Alteryx a great place to work.  Important decisions are made in back rooms about tools, technologies, and processes without the council and expertise of the people who are affected by these decisions.  Now, you are more likely to hear about what your team will look like or what tech stack you\u2019ll be using from your manager than you are to be asked about what the best next move is.  Confusion is rampant across all teams about what our next gen strategy is after two years of knowing that a next gen platform is imminent.  We don\u2019t know how to advance our careers and move up.  We do know not to mistake an open door for an opportunity to speak the truth.  We are people persecuted and furloughed for dissenting and being honest.  You toe the line, present a unified front, or you sit down and shut up.\r\n\r\nManagement is upside down - it presumes to know what\u2019s best for contributors and has lost sight of the fact that they are public servants. Could we please have leaders who didn\u2019t constantly trip over their own egos, hush people in meetings, and misinterpret the fortune of being lucky enough to lead incredibly intelligent people to mean that they have divine wisdom or insight that allows them to rule people instead of serve them?  It would be incredibly refreshing to have one of our leaders stand up and say, \u201cOK, now I know I can find a lot of people who will agree with what I\u2019m saying, but I want to hear from those who don\u2019t\u201d  It doesn\u2019t take much to surround yourself with and trumpet feedback from people who always agree with you and pretend like dissent doesn\u2019t exit or, worse, not even know it exists.  \r\n\r\nIf the now dozens of talented, experienced, tenured employees that have parted ways with us isn\u2019t enough for us to wake up and realize something foul is amiss, what about the people who have voluntarily stepped down from leadership roles?  How much more will we need to hear about it \u201cjust being growing pains\u201d or the \u201ctransition from small company mindedness\u201d to \u201cbig company mindedness\u201d or it taking a special person to be a leader rather than a contributor?  When are we going to address the elephants in the room?  \r\n\r\nWhen did Alteryx become fixated on being so utterly average, like every other corporate American company?  We have an opportunity to be different.  To do things our way.  To be servants to our employees and customers first, and to our investors third.  Shouldn\u2019t \u201ca billion\u201d really just be a bi-product of being an awesome place to work and having great customers who love us?  Our employees should feel excited to come to work because they are certain that their opinions and contributions matter.  No one wants to be dictated to and told after a big decision has been made.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I\u2019ll just be sitting here hanging on a little bit longer.  The Alteryx I knew is worth it.",

When I started at Alteryx, I thought it was the best job I've ever had; all these issues make it really difficult to stay optimistic.",
      "cons": "- Unresponsive upper management, at least in Engineering. Decisions are often made without adequately explaining reasoning or allowing for any feedback. Many employees are afraid of speaking up or mentioning certain sacred cow topics because of the possibility of retaliation, which does happen. Upper management will say that their doors are always open, but this isn't fostering communication- it's creating a situation where the burden of fixing glaring issues falls on rank-and-file employees who face the risk of retaliation if they say the wrong thing. Issues don't get addressed; they get buried.\r\n- Despite having a lot of great employees, Alteryx doesn't seem to intent on keeping them. Employee turnover is high and morale, at least in large parts of the organization, is low. Responses from senior management have mostly consisted of talking about issues unrelated to problems employees are actually concerned about. The turnover issue is rarely discussed and, when it is, it's typically dismissed outright.\r\n- Profoundly outdated technology. The infrastructure related to things like testing, version control and builds is old, clunky and a significant drain on productivity. These complaints have been going around Engineering for a very long time, but senior management dismisses them every time they're brought up.\r\n- Favoritism. Echoing another reviewer here, I heard some employees complain about senior management picking favorites, but I thought it was just sour grapes on their part. After having worked here for some time, though, it's true- there's an inner circle at Alteryx and, if you're not part of it, good luck climbing the ladder.\r\n- Poor planning and resource allocation. It's not unusual to see teams have to change direction completely. Usually, this happens because of shifts in overall company priorities, but even priority areas often remain under-staffed and under-resourced while other projects lower on the list of priorities wind up stuffed to the gills with engineers. Increasingly, projects are being given ambitious deadlines before a clear plan of how to tackle the problem or what even needs to be done has been established.",

It doesn't send a great message when your activities are limited to the few or aren't encouraged when the unrealistic targets are at risk (all the time).\r\n\r\n* Career education is a great concept if we didn't have to worry about job security. Getting the job done takes precedent at Alteryx. The struggle of maximizing my day to get the job done and have some resemblance of a life did not allow for extra curricular activities despite  feedback to management. Wouldn't recommend for people who have children or are planning to. \r\n\r\n* There is no logical reason for upward movement or any explaination of how to get there. The trend to promotion seemed to have been skewed towards individuals that are part of the unspoken crew (not by merit). Rewards also seemed to have been heavily biased towards those who spoke the loudest rather than on actual results.  \r\n\r\n* When feedback is given, listen, internalize and act. Understand that most people aren't in the position to or are too concerned about their job security to speak up. Don't brush off the few if they have the guts to speak their truth because it discredits your limited understanding of the situation. Start treating employees like customers to some degree so you don't lose them all. If people are afraid of how their feedback will be misconstrued as a reflection of their (or their manager's) performance, why would they bother raising them? In the end, our voices are often left unheard through proper channels and if it does get heard the response seems to be \"well that's not a good reason\" or \"you're the only one\". That might be fine in the average company but not in a fear based environment.\r\n\r\n* Listen to employees and give them an opportunity to create and run their ideas. Don't overlook the humanity in managing. You can only go so far when managing with stiff initiatives chasing the dollars in a constantly changing environment. \r\n\r\n* In the time I worked at Alteryx, there were many opportunities to refer my network to work at the company. For moral reasons, $4,000 wasn't worth the guilt of having to watch someone I referred suffer the way I and many of my fellow colleagues did after realizing the reality of working there. \r\n\r\n* More brilliant people will be leaving. Just because employees are there doesn't mean they like it there. Many are stuck needing to support their families and/or the opportunity for leaving isn't an option for personal reasons. Have you considered the unnecessary struggle on remaining employees and loss of productivity from frequent turnover? \r\n\r\n* Putting a bandaid on problems (like hiring new people or letting go valuable employees) doesn't prevent the cultural or functional issues from going away. It's time to figure out what the source of the problem is and find a solution. Continuing current methods aren't contributing to any inkling of positive morale.\r\n\r\n* The cycle of stress to meet ridiculously unrealistic targets seems heavily weighted in top leadership and intensifies immensely as it trickles down through the corporate hierarchy. With that level of stress on middle management, the ability to effectively manage their immediate teams is diminished. In specific cases resulted in selfish behavior over credit for the team. Hence the unhappy environment for all.\r\n\r\n* Departments cannot be silo'd. They need to work together to understand the full scope of a project, including how their process effects other teams. This means reasonable time to execute and willingness to talking to effected teams before rolling out a plan.  I often saw stiff initiatives pushed without basic understanding of realistic implementation just because it worked at another company. In the end, it becomes a \"my team\" vs \"your team\" situation that wasted ridiculous amounts of time in numerous meetings to fix implementation problems instead of actual productivity. The standard course of action is \"forget quality, just get the job done\".\r\n\r\n* Hasty decisions and hiding the truth behind vague generic excuses scripted for employees. It's one of the contributing factors of plummeting morale. You hire smart employees that naturally observe the environment and cope by discussing among themselves because we're not as gullible as you think. Secrets create a divide, insecurity and distrust of leadership. Honesty is the action of responsible leaders that respect their employees.\r\n\r\nIn short, Alteryx tops my list as the worst company I've had the privilege to work for. I've never seen anything like it. These are not just growing pains. Alteryx seems to have lost focus on what nourishes a stable and enjoyable company culture. I truly hope Alteryx understands that employees don't stay around for the kool-aid, they are loyal and dedicated to genuine leaders that lead with humanity.\r\n\r\nNote: I don't normally write reviews. But my experience working at Alteryx was in such contrast to what Alteryx is painting themselves to be that I felt it necessary to share my perspective publicly. This is in no way reflective of the experience in all departments, but the unique cultural discrepancy that existed in the position I was in.",
      "cons": "* No action or genuine concern of feedback regarding work/life balance and improvements to lacking culture. \r\n* Lack of understanding to the true potential of employees. Employees aren't given the opportunity to do what they were hired for.\r\n* Strained interdepartmental relationships due to silo'd teams assuming their past experience is universal. As such, there is a lack of interdepartmental understanding. \r\n* Alteryx seems to have a vision of the company they want to be and sells this story to potential new hires. As a result, many (including myself) quickly realized after a few months \"this isn't what I signed up for\". So turnover is higher than I've seen elsewhere.",

Be prepared to have your manager take you into a back office and tell the HR people on the record that you intentionally caused the problem and you alone bore responsibility, even if there was a systemic breakdown of process that your manager never addressed. \r\n\r\nKnow that these decisions will be made hundreds of miles away in a corporate office without hearing your side, or making an attempt to address the underlying causes. Note also that your position is still open, even months afterward, making you wonder if you were tossed on a pretense as a cost cutting measure since your team was overstaffed.",

However, it took the company 1 week to make that decision and the CEO, his buddy from the past, even wanted to protect him.\r\n\r\nOther than that the company has introduced MEDDPICC as a sales methodology and is creating more and more metrics to micromanage its employees. PG call days are blocked and activities are tracked. And this is just the beginning...\r\n\r\nMany people were let go at the beginning of the year and many more to follow because they will not want to work in this depressing culture. The high turnover is accepted by senior management as they look to bring in people who would do what they want and how they want it.\r\n\r\nAlteryx core products are still on-premis despite us living in the year 2021. When I was hired a few years ago I was told that the customers didnt care too much about it. Now almost all companies have cloud strategies and Alteryx is failing to move into the cloud due to a very weak and slow software engineering team.",

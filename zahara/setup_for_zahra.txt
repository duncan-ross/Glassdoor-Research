# Since my computer is new, I don't have a .zprofile. In order to access pip from any directory, the location pip was installed needds to added to the PATH. By putting it in the .zprofile, this will happen every time a new terminal is opened. Below are the commands to create a .zprofile (You may need to do this with .bashrc and .bash_profile if on an older Mac. You can look at the top of the terminal to see if it is zsh or bash.)
cd ~/
touch .zprofile
# Open the .zprofile and paste in the path to pip. Save. 
open -e .zprofile
export PATH="/Users/twhittle/Library/Python/2.7/bin:$PATH" 
^^ This will have to be modified to whatever your path is
